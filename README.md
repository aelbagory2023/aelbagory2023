Hello, my name is Ahmed Elbagory I am a computer technician who developed a passion for electronics at a young age, progressing from disassembling old devices to repairing them. 
As my expertise expanded, I transitioned from hardware troubleshooting to software exploration, seeking a holistic understanding of technology's problem-solving potential.
