👋 Hello! My name is Ahmed and I'm a Blockchain Developer and Web Development Enthusiast.

I specialize in building high-performance APIs using Express.js, managing over 100 million blockchain queries monthly, and developing Solidity smart contracts (ERC20, ERC721). My projects include API integrations across EVM chains and Solana, with a focus on reliability through rigorous unit and integration testing.

🌐 Tech Stack: JavaScript, TypeScript, ethers.js, solana.web3.js, Hardhat, GraphQL, Java, HTML/CSS, Git.

🚀 Transitioning from a successful career in project management, I recently completed a coding bootcamp at Tech Elevator, expanding my expertise in web applications. Fluent in English and Arabic, I’m passionate about merging quality-driven project management with innovative coding.
